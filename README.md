B) STATISTICAL SUMMARY-

From the output shown above, we can summarize the following:

1. The vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance have non-random impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Other variables such as the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) have p-Values that indicate a random amount of variance with the dataset.

2. The p-Value: 5.35e-11 for this model is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further indicates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

3. This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. This linear regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
